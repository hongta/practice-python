# Tree


### Binary Search Tree

  * insert : use the following algorithm, to insert a key `k`
    - If the tree is empty, construct a leaf node with key = `k`
    - If `k` is equal to the key of root node, overwrite the `payload`
    - If `k` is less then the key of root node, insert it into the left child
    - If `k` is greater than the key of root node, insert it into the right child
